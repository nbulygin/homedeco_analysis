  - Peak engagement: Tuesday evenings, Wednesday mornings
* **Price Sensitivity**:
  - Medium price range ($117-$138) shows highest conversion (0.168%)
  - No significant price sensitivity (p = 0.18)
* **Sales Anomalies**:
  - Significant sales spike in April 2022 (74.4% above mean)
  - Non-stationary sales pattern (p = 0.96)
  - Strong autocorrelation in daily sales (p < 0.01)

### Digital Performance
* **Traffic Analysis**:
  - Weekday average: 87 visits/day
  - Weekend average: 70 visits/day
  - Statistical significance: p < 0.001
* **Conversion Funnel**:
  - Best performing price segment: $117-$138 (medium range)
  - Strong relationship between traffic and sales (RÂ² = 32% at 2-month lag)

## Statistical Analysis
* **Time Series Decomposition**: Moderate seasonality (strength = 0.51)
* **Customer Journey**: 2-month optimal lag between traffic and sales (p < 0.001)
* **Purchase Behavior**: Significant difference between one-time and repeat customers (p < 0.0001)
